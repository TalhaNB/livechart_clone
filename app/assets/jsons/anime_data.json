The day that they lost the final tournament of middle school, Ashito runs along the ocean in frustration, before running into a man who had been watching his game. That man is Tatsuya Fukuda, the coach of the high-school-aged Youth team of a leading J-League team, \"Tokyo City Esperion FC.\" After sensing immense potential in Ashito's still-unrefined skills, he describes his ambition. \"I want to build a team, and use it to take over the world. Our club isn't going to be a milestone for players who take on the world. Our club is going to be the world. And to make this happen, I'm going to need some 'aces' to train.\" After hearing Fukuda's offer, Ashito decides to head to Tokyo and try out for his team── Aoashi is considered the cutting edge of soccer manga, and now it's finally getting a TV anime adaptation! Loss, growth, and friendship: everything in youth is here!",
